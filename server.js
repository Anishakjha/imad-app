    One of the hardest things about improving your life is remembering to practice what you've learned in a moment of temptation, frustration, or hardship. Anyone can follow a strategy as they read about it, but remembering to stick with it in the real world is tough.
</p>
<p>
      Stories help with that. An engaging story sticks with you in a way that a research finding often can't. While JamesClear.com promotes science-backed ideas, we don't shun stories and lessons based on real life.

Imagine if I was given one moment,
just a single slice of my past.
I could hold it close forever,
and that moment would always last.
</p>


<p>
I'd put the moment in a safe,
within my hearts abode.
I could open it when I wanted,
and only I would know the code.
</p>

<p>
I could choose a time of laughing,
a time of happiness and fun.
I could choose a time that tried me,
through everything I've done.
</P>

<p>
I sat and thought about what moment,
would always make me smile.
One that would always push me,
to walk that extra mile.
</p>

<p>
If I'm feeling sad and low,
if I'm struggling with what to do.
I can go and open my little safe,
and watch my moment through.
</p>

<p>
There are moments I can think of,
that would lift my spirits everytime.
The moments when you picked me up,
when the road was hard to climb.
</p>

<p>
For me to only pick one moment,
to cherish, save and keep,
Is proving really difficult,
as I've gathered up a heap!
</p>

<p>
I've dug deep inside my heart,
found the safe and looked inside,
there was room for lots of moments,
in fact hundreds if I tried.
</p>

<p>
I'm building my own little library,
embedded in my heart,
for all the moments spent with you,
before you had to part.
</p>

<p>
I can open it up whenever I like,
pick a moment and watch it through,
My little library acts as a promise,
I'll never ever forget you
